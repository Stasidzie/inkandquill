Minecraft Forge mod that adds some useful tweaks for minecraft writing and drawing:
- a map can now be crafted without wasting a compass but using a new ink and quill item
- name tags and papers can now be renamed without an anvil but simply with ink and quill in second hand
- it is no longer necessary to search for squid to craft a writable book because ink can be made from black dye
- black dye can now be made from charcoal
